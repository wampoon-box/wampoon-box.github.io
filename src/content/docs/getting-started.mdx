## Portable Bundle (Recommended)

The portable bundle is the easiest way to get started. It's pre-configured and works out of the box on all Windows versions.

<Steps>

1. Download the portable archive: <LinkButton href="https://github.com/wampoon-box/wampoon-installer/releases/latest/download/wampoon-portable-v1.1.0.zip" variant="primary" icon="external" iconPlacement="end"> wampoon-portable-v1.1.0.zip </LinkButton>
2. Extract the ZIP file to any folder.
3. Run `WampoonControl.exe` to open the control panel.

</Steps>

## Using the Installer

If you prefer a guided setup, you can use the installer instead.

<Steps>

1. Download the installer: <LinkButton href="https://github.com/wampoon-box/wampoon-installer/releases/latest/download/Wampoon-Installer-v1.1.0.zip" variant="primary" icon="external" iconPlacement="end"> Wampoon-Installer.zip </LinkButton>
2. Extract the ZIP file and run `Wampoon-Installer.exe`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions.

</Steps>

:::note[phpMyAdmin Advanced Features]
The installer doesn't enable phpMyAdmin's advanced features (bookmarks, PDF generation, designer mode, relation tracking). These require additional setup — see the [phpMyAdmin configuration guide](/guides/phpmyadmin) if you need them.

## Verifying Your Installation

1. Run `WampoonControl.exe` from your Wampoon folder.
2. Start both Apache and MariaDB services — they should show a green "Running" status.
3. Open `http://localhost` in your browser. You should see the Wampoon Dashboard.
4. From the dashboard, click **phpMyAdmin** to verify database access and **PHP Info** to check PHP is configured correctly.

If everything works, you're all set!
