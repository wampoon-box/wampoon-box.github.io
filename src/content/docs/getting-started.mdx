Welcome to Wampoon! This guide will help you get started with the Wampoon local development stack.

## Installing Wampoon

Depending on your preference, Wampoon can be installed in **two different ways**, either using the Wampoon Installer or the Wampoon Portable Bundle.

:::caution[Prerequisites]
Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 11
:::


### 1. Using the Wampoon Installer

This option provides a guided setup process.

1. Download the latest installer archive at:
<LinkButton  href="https://github.com/wampoon-box/wampoon-installer/releases/latest/download/Wampoon-Installer.zip" variant="primary"  icon="external" iconPlacement="end">
  Wampoon-Installer.zip
</LinkButton>
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a local folder.
3. Run **`Wampoon-Installer.exe`** to launch the installer and follow the instructions.

:::note[phpMyAdmin Advanced Features]
The installer does not enable phpMyAdmin's advanced features. These features must be enabled manually by following the [phpMyAdmin configuration guide](/guides/phpmyadmin).

### 2. Using the Wampoon Portable Bundle (Recommended)

This is the **recommended option** for most users as it was tested and works out of the box on all Windows versions.

This option gives you a **preconfigured**, portable Wampoon environment that runs without installation.

**Install instructions:**
1. Download the portable archive from the Wampoon GitHub Releases page at:
<LinkButton  href="https://github.com/wampoon-box/wampoon-installer/releases/latest/download/Wampoon-portable-1.0.0.zip" variant="primary"  icon="external" iconPlacement="end">
  Wampoon-portable-1.0.0.zip
</LinkButton>   
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a local folder.
3. That's it! You can now run **`WampoonControl.exe`** to start Wampoon's control panel.

The portable bundle comes preconfigured with the following components:

* **Apache HTTP Server** — 2.4.65.0
* **MariaDB Server** — 11.8.3.0
* **PHP Runtime** — 8.4.10.0
