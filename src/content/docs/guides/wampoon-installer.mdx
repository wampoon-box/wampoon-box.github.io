The Wampoon Installer is a desktop application that downloads and configures the Wampoon stack on your machine. For basic installation steps, see the [Installation guide](/getting-started/#using-the-installer).

## Package Sources

The installer can fetch component versions from different sources:

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Web Manifest (default) | Downloads the latest versions from the [remote manifest](https://github.com/wampoon-box/wampoon-packages/blob/main/packagesInfo.json) |
| Local File | Uses a local `packagesInfo.json` file for offline or pinned installs |
| Auto | Tries the web manifest first, falls back to local if unavailable |

You can switch between sources using the **Package Source** dropdown in the installer window.

## Using a Local Manifest

If you need to install specific versions or work offline, you can use a local manifest file.

### Setup

1. Open the `Data` folder next to `Wampoon-Installer.exe` in the Wampoon installer directory.
2. Edit the `packagesInfo.json` file with your desired package versions. Update the `Version` field and replace any outdated or dead download URLs in the `DownloadUrl` field with working links. See the [package IDs](#package-ids) table for the download pages where you can find current versions.
3. In the installer, select **Local File Only** from the Package Source dropdown.

### File Format

The manifest is a JSON array of package definitions:

```json
[
  {
    "PackageID": 1,
    "Name": "Apache HTTP Server",
    "Version": "2.4.65.0",
    "DownloadUrl": "https://www.apachelounge.com/download/VS17/binaries/httpd-2.4.65-250724-Win64-VS17.zip",
    "PackageWebsite": "https://www.apachelounge.com/download/",
    "Checksum": ""
  },
  {
    "PackageID": 4,
    "Name": "PHP Runtime",
    "Version": "8.5.1.0",
    "DownloadUrl": "https://downloads.php.net/~windows/releases/archives/php-8.5.1-Win32-vs17-x64.zip",
    "PackageWebsite": "https://windows.php.net/download/",
    "Checksum": ""
  }
]
```

For a complete example, see the [remote manifest file](https://github.com/wampoon-box/wampoon-packages/blob/main/packagesInfo.json).

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load packages from web manifest"

- Check your internet connection
- Make sure GitHub is accessible from your network
- Switch to **Local File Only** as a fallback

### "Failed to load packages from local file"

- Verify `Data/packagesInfo.json` exists next to the installer
- Check the JSON syntax is valid
- Make sure all required fields are present (PackageID, Name, Version, DownloadUrl)

### "Manifest URL is not allowed"

The installer only accepts manifest URLs from GitHub domains (`raw.githubusercontent.com`, `github.com`, `api.github.com`) over HTTPS.
