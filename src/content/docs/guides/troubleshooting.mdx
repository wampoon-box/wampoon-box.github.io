If you encounter issues during or after installation, try these common solutions:

## Services Won't Start

**Port Conflicts:**
- **Problem:** Apache or MariaDB fails to start
- **Solution:** Check if ports 80, 443 (Apache) or 3306 (MariaDB) are already in use by other applications
- **How to check:** Use the command `netstat -ano | findstr :80` in Command Prompt to see which process is using port 80
- **Common culprits:** Skype, IIS, other web servers, or existing MySQL installations

## Firewall or Antivirus Blocking

**Blocked Executables:**
- **Problem:** Windows Firewall or antivirus software blocks Wampoon components
- **Solution:** Add exceptions for `httpd.exe` (Apache) and `mysqld.exe` (MariaDB) in your security software
- **Note:** Some antivirus programs may quarantine these files; restore them and add them to the whitelist

## Cannot Access http://localhost

**Service Not Running:**
- **Problem:** Browser shows "connection refused" or "site can't be reached"
- **Solution:** Verify Apache is running in the Wampoon Control Panel
- **Alternative:** Try `http://127.0.0.1` instead of `http://localhost`

## Permission Issues

**Access Denied Errors:**
- **Problem:** Cannot write files or modify configuration
- **Solution:** Run `WampoonControl.exe` as Administrator (right-click > Run as administrator)
- **Note:** On some systems, you may need to install Wampoon in a non-system directory (outside of `C:\Program Files`)

## Visual C++ Runtime Errors

**Missing DLL Files:**
- **Problem:** Error messages about missing `VCRUNTIME140.dll` or similar
- **Solution:** The portable bundle includes Visual C++ Runtime, but you may need to install it manually
- **Download:** [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
