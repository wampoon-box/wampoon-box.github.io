The Wampoon Control Panel is a desktop application that allows you to manage Apache, MariaDB, PHP, and other components of the Wampoon stack.

## Starting Servers from the Command Line

You can pass flags to `WampoonControl.exe` to start servers automatically without interacting with the UI. Useful for scripting or scheduled tasks:

```
WampoonControl.exe --start-all        # Start both Apache and MariaDB
WampoonControl.exe --start-apache     # Start Apache only
WampoonControl.exe --start-mariadb    # Start MariaDB only
```

## Starting Servers on Windows Boot

To have your servers start automatically every time you log into Windows:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press **Enter** to open the Startup folder.
2. Create a shortcut to `WampoonControl.exe` in that folder.
3. Right-click the shortcut → **Properties** → in the **Target** field, append `--start-all` after the executable path.
4. Click **OK**.

Next time you log in, both Apache and MariaDB will start automatically and the control panel will minimize quietly to the system tray.
