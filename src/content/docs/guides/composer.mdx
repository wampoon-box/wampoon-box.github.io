title: Using Composer with Wampoon
description: Learn how to use the portable Composer bundled with Wampoon.
---

Wampoon includes a fully portable version of Composer that works without global installation. Since Wampoon is portable, it provides batch scripts that configure the PHP path before running Composer.

:::caution[Don't Use Global PHP/Composer]
Always use Wampoon's `composer.bat` and `php.bat` scripts instead of any globally installed PHP or Composer. This ensures the correct PHP version and extensions are used.
:::

:::note[Example Paths]
The examples on this page use `C:\Wampoon` as the installation directory. Replace this with the actual path where you extracted Wampoon.

## Available Scripts

Wampoon provides batch scripts that configure the PHP path before running Composer:

| Script | Location | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `composer.bat` | `htdocs/` | Convenient script for managing projects in htdocs |
| `composer.bat` | Root folder | Runs Composer with the correct PHP path |
| `php.bat` | Root folder | Runs PHP with the correct environment |

## Using Composer

To use Composer, open a command prompt and navigate to the `htdocs` folder, then run commands using `composer.bat`:

```batch
cd C:\Wampoon\htdocs
composer.bat install
```

Or use the full path from any location:

```batch
C:\Wampoon\htdocs\composer.bat --working-dir=C:\Wampoon\htdocs\my-project install
```

### Common Commands

If you have multiple projects in `htdocs`, navigate to your project directory first:

```batch
cd C:\Wampoon\htdocs\my-project

:: Install dependencies from composer.json
composer.bat install

:: Add a package
composer.bat require vendor/package

:: Update all packages
composer.bat update
```

## Creating a New Project

Use the `composer create-project` command to scaffold new applications directly in your `htdocs` folder.

### From the htdocs Folder

Open a command prompt in `htdocs` and run:

```batch
cd C:\Wampoon\htdocs
composer.bat create-project laravel/laravel my-laravel-app
```

### Popular Frameworks

```batch
:: Laravel
composer.bat create-project laravel/laravel my-app

:: Symfony
composer.bat create-project symfony/skeleton my-app

:: Slim Framework
composer.bat create-project slim/slim-skeleton my-app

:: CakePHP
composer.bat create-project cakephp/app my-app
```

After creating a project, access it at `http://localhost/my-app` (or the appropriate entry point for your framework).

## Using PHP Directly

If you need to run PHP scripts directly, use `php.bat` from the root folder:

```batch
C:\Wampoon\php.bat -v
C:\Wampoon\php.bat script.php
```

---

## Adding to PATH (Optional)

If you frequently use Composer from the command line, you can add the Wampoon folder to your PATH environment variable for the current session:

```batch
set PATH=C:\Wampoon;%PATH%
```

Then you can run commands directly:

```batch
composer.bat install
php.bat -v
```
